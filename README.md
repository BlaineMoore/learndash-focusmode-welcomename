# LearnDash - Focus Mode Welcome Name
A simple WordPress plugin that switches the LearnDash Focus Mode Welcome Name from the user nicename to the user display_name.

That way when they are greeted in the navbar of focus mode, it uses the display name they've chosen rather than a sanitized version of their username.

Requires the [LearnDash plugin](https://apexauthors.com/LearnDash) for WordPress, a learning management system.
